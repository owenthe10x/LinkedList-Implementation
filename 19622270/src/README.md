## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of linked list which i learn through several resources. I use the concept of Object Oriented Programming paradigm to implement the linked list concept.

&nbsp;

## Folder Explanation

This repository consists of 3 folders:

1. bin : The bin folder contains the executable file that the user's going to run to use the program.
2. src : The src folder is consisting of 3 files
   - Linkedlist.hpp : this file is used to define the LinkedList class, class method, and functions.
   - LinkedList.cpp : this file is used to implement all of the method and functions defined on the .hpp file.
   - main.cpp : this is the file that will be executed as the main program.
3. doc : The doc folder consist of a pdf file which consists of all documentation of how the program works.

&nbsp;

## How to Run the Program

1. When the program starts, it will directly asks user to input all of the elements for each three lists. The user can input as much element as they want, and when they want to stop, they can just enter the value "-9999".
2. After initializing all three lists, the user will be directed to the main menu.
3. In the main menu, the user will be presented 12 different menus with different use case including the exit menu.
4. The menus are straightforward so it is self-explanatory.
5. If the user is done with the program, they can choose the 12th menu which is exit to exit the program.
